# gobeaves

I designed a map to be Oregon State university themed and titled it gobeavs. I decided to make my building Orange and my streets black. I decided alter the visibility of the building to specific zoom levels because I didn't want the map to be too cluttered from far away. However when the map is zoomed out to the state or country or world level I still decided to leave titles in Orange and Black. With white also being a team color I decided to make all background white or very light grey because I still is obvious that it is background and it still works as school color.
